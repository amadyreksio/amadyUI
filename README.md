# amadyUI
amady UI is a library for .net framework apps containing round buttons and more!
I made it so you don't have to pay for GUNA or BUNIFU.

You can use it however you want.

List of controls:

## FancyCheckBox
This control is work in progress so i don't recommend using it.

## FancyProgressBar
Round progress bar with smooth animations.

## RoundPanel
You can achieve the same effect by adding roundifier to a normal panel.

## Roundifier
Adds rounded corners to any control. You can adjust the radius.

## amadyButton
Round button with smooth animations and selected mode

## amadyScrollbar
Round and smooth scrollbar that can scroll any control.
